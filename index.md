# 👋 Hello, I am Askin KELES.

**I am a Physics Engineer.** Throughout my career, I have taken on roles ranging from engineering to senior executive positions in Türkiye's critical institutions.

Especially in recent years, focusing on **Embedded Hardware Design** and **Software Engineering**, I both formulate management strategies and actively develop end-to-end systems (PCB, Firmware, Software).

## 🛠️ Technical Expertise

For me, technology is not just about using it, but **designing** it.

### [1. Hardware Engineering & Embedded Systems](./HARDWARE)
Professional architectures and guides on ESP32, STM32, and industrial sensors.
* *Highlights:* Industrial UART, SPI DMA, CAN Bus Protocols.

### [2. Infrastructure & Network Architecture](./INFRASTRUCTURE)
Data centers, disaster recovery scenarios, and high-security network topologies.

### [3. Strategic Management](./MANAGEMENT)
Performance-Based Budgeting and Decision Support Systems (DSS) for public institutions.
